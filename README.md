 The purpose of this project is to create a stair lighting system where the illumination occur in sequence instead of a lighting that just turns on illuminating the entire stair environment. This lighting method provides a more pleasing visual effect, causes less disturbance to the overall ambience arround the stair and provide illumination color scheme easily configurable by user to fit seasonal color themes.
